# ParliamentApp
A mobile application on the phone that takes data from a json file and shows the parties currently represented in the Finnish Parliament. 
By clicking on a party, you can go to the next page, where all the participants of this party will be presented. 
Clicking on a member takes the user to the member's detail page, where they can find additional information such as year of birth, 
Twitter account if one exists, and rate the member.
